Azure Scaffold has been superseded by Azure Blueprints, Management Groups and [Azure Governance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/). 
The templates in this repo give examples of how single-region and multi-region network 
infrastructure can be generalized for use with environment-specific parameters in an Azure Blueprint.
